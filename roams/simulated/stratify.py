    Take an array of simulated emissions and corresponding production, 
    and sample the emissions it into a `n_infra`-length array.

    The goal is to stratify the sampling, so that, for example, 
    simulated sites with production that fall between the 10th and 20th 
    percentiles of production in `covered_productivity` will be sampled 
    into 10 percent of the resulting observations.

    This process is repeated for each of the quantile bins specified in 
    the `quantiles` argument.

    Args:
        sim_emissions (np.ndarray):
            A 1-d array of simulated emissions (kg/h) in the whole basin, or 
            at least of an area that's not expected to be completely 
            representative of the infrastructure covered in the survey.

        sim_production (np.ndarray):
            Simulated production, whose values correspond index-wise to those 
            in sim_emissions. Should be in units identical to 
            `covered_productivity`.

        covered_productivity (np.ndarray):
            A 1-d array representing the best estimate of actual production 
            in the surveyed area, in identical units to `sim_production`.

        n_infra (int):
            The size of the resulting array to return, intended to represent 
            the amount of infrastructure you're trying to create 
            estimates for.

        quantiles (tuple[float], optional): 
            The quantile bins (including the limits 0 and 1) into which the 
            covered 
            Defaults to QUANTILES.

    Raises:
        ValueError: 
            When the length of simulated emissions and corresponding simulated 
            production don't match.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: 
            A `n_infra`-length array representing a production-weighted sample 
            of the simulated emissions data.
