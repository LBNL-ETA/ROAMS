    """
    Take an array of simulated emissions and corresponding production, 
    and perform a stratified sampling of the emissions into a 
    `n_infra` x `n_mc_iterations` size table.

    The process of stratification is intended to make it so that the 
    simulated emissions correspond to simulated productivity whose 
    distribution better matches the given covered productivity distribution.

    It begins by defining pre-specified quantiles of simulated productivity. 
    Using these quantile boundaries, the code then computes the fraction of 
    the covered productivity distribution that falls into each bin of 
    simulated productivity. It uses this fraction to then estimate a total 
    number of simulated infrastructure (n_infra) that should be represented 
    by sampling simulated emissions associated to the simulated productivity 
    in this bin.

    This process is repeated for each of the quantile bins specified in 
    the `quantiles` argument.

    Args:
        sim_emissions (np.ndarray):
            A 1-d array of simulated emissions (kg/h) in the whole basin, or 
            at least of an area that's not expected to be completely 
            representative of the infrastructure covered in the survey.

        sim_production (np.ndarray):
            Simulated production, whose values correspond index-wise to those 
            in sim_emissions. Should be in units identical to 
            `covered_productivity`.

        covered_productivity (np.ndarray):
            A 1-d array representing the best estimate distribution of actual 
            production in the surveyed area, in identical units to 
            `sim_production`. The values in this array should correspond to 
            productivity bounds of a uniform quantization of covered 
            productivity. For example, there could be 1000 values, each 
            representing the 0.1 percentile bound, the 0.2 percentile bound, 
            etc. Or there could be 100 values representing the 1% bound, the 
            2% bound, etc. The important things are that (a) each value 
            represents a bin of the same size, and that for best results, (b) 
            the size the bins is at most the size of the smallest bin in 
            `quantiles` (e.g., if the smallest `quantile` bin is a 0.1% 
            increment, covered_productivity should be at most in 0.1% 
            increments, i.e. at least 1000 values).

        n_infra (int):
            The size of the resulting array to return, intended to represent 
            the amount of infrastructure you're trying to create 
            estimates for.

        n_mc_samples (int):
            The number of monte-carlo iterations being done, which will 
            control the size of the returned table, specifically the number 
            of columns.

        quantiles (tuple[float], optional): 
            The quantile bins (including the limits 0 and 1) into which the 
            covered 
            Defaults to QUANTILES.

    Raises:
        ValueError: 
            When the length of simulated emissions and corresponding simulated 
            production don't match.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: 
            A `n_infra` x `n_mc_iterations` table representing a 
            production-weighted sample of the simulated emissions data, for 
            each monte-carlo iteration of the ROAMS process.
